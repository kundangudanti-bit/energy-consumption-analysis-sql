# Energy Consumption Analysis – SQL Project

## Overview
This project uses SQL to analyze global energy consumption, production, emissions,
GDP, and population data to identify trends, patterns, and efficiency metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset includes country-level information on energy usage, emissions, GDP,
population, and related indicators.

## Tools Used
- SQL
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench

## Analysis Performed
- Multi-table joins and aggregations
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Subqueries for complex analysis
- Per-capita and ratio-based comparisons

## Key Insights
- Identified trends in energy consumption across countries
- Compared energy efficiency using per-capita metrics
- Analyzed relationships between energy usage, GDP, and emissions

## Conclusion
The analysis provides data-driven insights into global energy patterns and supports
comparative evaluation of energy efficiency across countries.
